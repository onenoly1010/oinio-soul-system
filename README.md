# 🌾🌌 OINIO Soul System

**A private encrypted oracle for soul evolution through epochs.**

Dependency-free. Unified. Sealed for executable form.

## ✨ Features

- **Deterministic Oracle** — Same question + soul + epoch = same reading
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** — All souls protected by your passphrase
- **Zero Dependencies** — Standalone binaries, no Node.js required
- **Cross-Platform** — Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Private & Local** — All data stays on your machine

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download the binary for your OS from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Make it executable (Linux/macOS): `chmod +x oinio-system-*`
3. Run: `./oinio-system-linux` (or your platform's binary)
4. Enter a master passphrase (creates encrypted vault)
5. Create your first soul and begin the epoch cycle

## 📦 Binaries

- `oinio-system-linux` — Linux x64
- `oinio-system-macos` — macOS x64
- `oinio-system-win.exe` — Windows x64

## 🔐 Security

- Master passphrase derives encryption key (SHA-256)
- All soul data encrypted in `souls.enc`
- No network calls, no telemetry
- Deterministic readings from cryptographic hashing

## 🌊 The Pattern

Each oracle reading generates:
- **Resonance, Clarity, Flux, Emergence** (1-100%)
- **Pattern Recognition** (The Spiral, The Mirror, etc.)
- **Oracle Message** (deterministic wisdom)

The same question asked to the same soul at the same epoch will always yield the same reading — the pattern remembers itself.

## 📜 Export Lineage

Export your soul history to CSV: `lineage.csv`

## 🛡️ Privacy

This is a **personal oracle system**. All data remains local. No cloud sync, no tracking.
