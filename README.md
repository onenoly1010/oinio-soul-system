# 🌾🌌 OINIO Soul System

**A private encrypted oracle for soul evolution through epochs.**

Dependency-free. Unified. Sealed for executable form.

## ✨ Features

- **Deterministic Oracle** — Same question + soul + epoch = same reading
- **⚡ Quantum Enhancement** — Optional AI-powered harmony predictions via Pi Forge integration
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** — All souls protected by your passphrase
- **Zero Dependencies** — Standalone binaries, no Node.js required
- **Cross-Platform** — Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Private & Local** — All data stays on your machine
- **Dual-Mode Oracle** — Toggle between deterministic and quantum-enhanced readings

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download the binary for your OS from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Make it executable (Linux/macOS): `chmod +x oinio-system-*`
3. Run: `./oinio-system-linux` (or your platform's binary)
4. Enter a master passphrase (creates encrypted vault)
5. Create your first soul and begin the epoch cycle

## 🛡️ Security & Safety Warnings

**This software is completely safe.** You may see security warnings because the binaries are not code-signed (which costs $$$ annually). Here's how to proceed:

### Why Warnings Appear
- Binaries are **unsigned** (not from Microsoft/Apple verified developer)
- This is normal for open-source projects
- **All source code is visible** in this repository — inspect it yourself!

### How to Bypass Warnings

**Windows:**
- If Windows Defender blocks it: Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**
- If SmartScreen appears: **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**
- You can also right-click → **Properties** → check **"Unblock"** → Apply

**macOS:**
- Right-click the binary → **"Open"** (don't double-click)
- Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
- Or: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow app to run

**Linux:**
- Usually no warnings
- If permission denied: `chmod +x oinio-system-linux`

### Build It Yourself (Ultimate Safety)
Don't trust binaries? Build from source:
```bash
npm install -g pkg
git clone https://github.com/onenoly1010/oinio-soul-system
cd oinio-soul-system
pkg oinio-system.js --targets node18-linux-x64
```

**Your data stays local.** No network calls. No telemetry. Inspect the code!

## 📦 Binaries

- `oinio-system-linux` — Linux x64
- `oinio-system-macos` — macOS x64
- `oinio-system-win.exe` — Windows x64

## 🔐 Security

- Master passphrase derives encryption key (SHA-256)
- All soul data encrypted in `souls.enc`
- No network calls, no telemetry
- Deterministic readings from cryptographic hashing

## 🌊 The Pattern

Each oracle reading generates:
- **Resonance, Clarity, Flux, Emergence** (1-100%)
- **Pattern Recognition** (The Spiral, The Mirror, etc.)
- **Oracle Message** (deterministic wisdom)

### ⚡ Quantum Enhancement (Optional)
When Pi Forge Quantum Genesis is available, readings also include:
- **Harmony Index** — AI-predicted system harmony (0-100%)
- **Trend Analysis** — Improving/declining/stable with confidence scores
- **Quantum Insights** — ML-generated contextual wisdom
- **Forge Recommendations** — AI-powered actionable guidance

**Deterministic mode:** Same question = same answer (always)  
**Quantum mode:** Context-aware AI predictions layered on top  
**The synthesis:** Pattern + Trajectory = Navigation

## 📜 Export Lineage

Export your soul history to CSV: `lineage.csv`

## ⚡ Quantum Forge Integration

OINIO can optionally integrate with **Pi Forge Quantum Genesis** for AI-enhanced readings:

1. Clone Pi Forge: `git clone https://github.com/onenoly1010/pi-forge-quantum-genesis`
2. Set path: `export PI_FORGE_PATH="/path/to/pi-forge-quantum-genesis"`
3. Press **[Q]** in soul menu to toggle quantum mode
4. Readings automatically enhanced with harmony predictions

Works standalone without Forge. Quantum layer is purely optional enhancement.

See [OINIO-FORGE-INTEGRATION.md](OINIO-FORGE-INTEGRATION.md) for full details.

## 🛡️ Privacy

This is a **personal oracle system**. All data remains local. No cloud sync, no tracking. Quantum mode only shares partial seed (8 chars) with local Forge process.
