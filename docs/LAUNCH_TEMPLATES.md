**Title:** [Release] OINIO Soul System v1.3.0 - Encrypted Deterministic Oracle CLI

**Body:**
```
I just released v1.3.0 of OINIO Soul System, a deterministic cryptographic oracle for personal divination.

## ✨ What is it?

- Offline, encrypted oracle system
- Deterministic readings (same question = same answer)
- Multi-user with PBKDF2 authentication
- Optional AI quantum enhancement via Pi Forge
- Zero external dependencies, fully standalone

## 🔒 Security

- AES-256-GCM encryption
- 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations
- Timing-safe password verification
- All data stays local
- No telemetry, no tracking

## 📦 New in v1.3.0

- **Code Quality:** Eliminated 52 lines of duplicate code
- **CLI Polish:** Added `--version` and `--help` flags
- **Configuration:** Centralized config system with environment variables
- **Cross-Platform:** Proper HOME directory fallback (no more hardcoded paths)
- **Ready for Phase 2:** Prepared for web deployment

## 🚀 Download

Binaries for all platforms:  
https://github.com/onenoly1010/oinio-soul-system/releases/tag/v1.3.0

## 🔮 How it works

1. Create a "soul" (unique cryptographic seed)
2. Ask questions to the oracle
3. Receive deterministic readings based on SHA-256 hashing
4. Same question always gives the same answer
5. Different souls give different answers to the same question

## 🌐 What's Next

Phase 2 is coming:
- Web interface
- REST API
- Docker deployment
- Mobile-friendly UI
- Subscription tiers (freemium model)

## 📖 Technical Details

- Built with Node.js crypto module
- No external dependencies
- MIT licensed
- Open source: https://github.com/onenoly1010/oinio-soul-system

Feedback and contributions welcome!

## Reddit - r/divination

**Title:** OINIO v1.3.0: Deterministic Cryptographic Oracle - Your Questions, Eternal Answers

**Body:**
```
I've been working on a unique divination tool that combines cryptography with oracle readings, and I just released v1.3.0.

## 🔮 What makes OINIO different?

Unlike traditional divination methods or random number generators, OINIO is **deterministic**:

- Ask the same question → Get the same answer (always)
- Your "soul" (unique seed) determines your readings
- Based on SHA-256 cryptographic hashing
- Completely private and offline

## 🌟 How it works

1. Create a "soul" with a unique cryptographic seed
2. Ask your question
3. The oracle generates a reading from:
   - Your question
   - Your soul's seed
   - The epoch number (consultation count)
4. Same inputs = same reading (reproducible wisdom)

## 📊 Readings Include

- Resonance (1-100%)
- Clarity (1-100%)
- Flux (1-100%)
- Emergence (1-100%)
- Pattern Recognition (The Spiral, The Mirror, etc.)
- Oracle Message (archetypal wisdom)

## ⚡ Optional Quantum Mode

Can integrate with AI (Pi Forge) for enhanced readings:
- Harmony predictions
- Trend analysis
- Contextual insights
- Still deterministic at the core

## 🔐 Privacy &amp; Security

- All data encrypted (AES-256-GCM)
- Everything stays on your device
- No cloud, no telemetry, no tracking
- Multi-user with separate accounts

## 📦 New in v1.3.0

- Cleaner codebase
- Better CLI experience
- Configuration system
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 💾 Download

Free and open source:  
https://github.com/onenoly1010/oinio-soul-system/releases/tag/v1.3.0

Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🙏 Feedback Welcome

This is a passion project combining my interests in divination, cryptography, and philosophy. I'd love to hear your thoughts!

**Title:** Show HN: OINIO Soul System – Encrypted deterministic oracle CLI

**URL:** https://github.com/onenoly1010/oinio-soul-system

**Text (optional):**
```
I built a deterministic oracle system that generates reproducible "readings" from questions using SHA-256 hashing.

Key technical features:
- Deterministic: same question + seed + epoch → same reading (always)
- Encrypted: AES-256-GCM for all user data
- Multi-user: PBKDF2 authentication with timing-safe comparison
- Quantum mode: optional AI enhancement via separate module
- Zero dependencies: uses only Node.js built-ins
- Cross-platform: standalone binaries for Win/Mac/Linux

How it works:
1. User creates a "soul" (unique 256-bit seed)
2. Asks a question
3. System computes SHA-256(question | seed | epoch)
4. Extracts deterministic values from hash bytes
5. Maps to oracle reading (resonance, clarity, pattern, message)

Same inputs always produce identical outputs - reproducible wisdom.

Just released v1.3.0 with configuration system and CLI polish. Next phase: web interface + REST API.

Built with Node.js crypto module. MIT licensed.
